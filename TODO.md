* Add a placeholder image to use for albums and artists for which the art
  couldn't be/wasn't fecthed
* SongsFragment should listen to album updates so that missing album art
  can be updated in the list after it is fetched

Clean code

* Retrofit the image fetchers (not urgent, code is quite clean)

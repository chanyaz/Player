Album Player
============

*Album Player* is an Android music player app that puts the emphasis on the album.
The app encourages you to play music album by album. It keeps track of
where you left off within a specific album even if you switch to a
different one. Album year and number of plays are displayed prominently
on multiple screens.

This app is a work in progress primarily set up for me to try out various
API's, designs and techniques related to Android development. At the same time
it correctly handles a couple of things correctly that seem to be buggy even in
Google's official music player such as:
- Displays correct length of MP3 files stored with a variable bit-rate (VBR)
- Correctly displays song and albums names that containt special (UTF-8) characters

Also, every music lover knows that albums are pieces of art that should be played
as a whole, so this app tries to take care of that ;)
